# Why Western Minimalism 
## by Richard Pham 

A lot could be wondered about the state of single-story buildings, miniaturized 
skyscrapers, and fragmented transportation system overseen by administrators that 
are most likely not fans of these systems turning transcontinental. There are a lot of 
people, according to the statistics. The people could be put to work, ok. They do not have 
to sit around, watch and sightseer, loaf around, and meddle in other people's affairs. That 
is pure social business. But the murky aspect to this freedom is that social business does 
not result in minimal manifestation. Social business affects the mind and turns its participants 
into what can be considered stations to be pinged, ports to receive goods, and anchors to immobilize 
the functions specially designed into product (so it really is all for show). A hard line could be drawn, 
for clarity, between the elaborate multi-tiered constructs devised by human beings and the complexities 
(with or without fruit) of social business. The social business does not have to yield great harvests 
or bring about discernible change of any point on the spectrum of negative to positive. "It just is, 
things just are, and let things be" are common defenses of the results of social business. And truthfully, 
it is rare to find anyone that has the time of effort as well as the genuine passion to challenge these 
defenses, based on collective notions of the norm and of adhering to the chain, without eventually 
learning lessons on what makes a good subject rather than a good slave; slaves labor past their point 
of comfort, past the point where their minds are accurate receptors of stimuli and where their minds 
direct their bodies (when there is evidence every now and then of fluctuations of the heart moving the body 
and the body swaying the mind into a tail rather than a head). 

Some frequent themes emerge, under the umbrella of social critique on the policies of minimalism (maybe it is 
better to phrase "policies" as a "lack of concert from policies not agreed on"). If only all problems can be 
solved by building more after or without breaking less, these problems can be measured by the arbitrary value 
of metric used on a consistent basis for effective execution. But no, things break along the way and sometime after 
that, new workers with improved metrics to address the problem instead of building on top of it, like grounds for 
a gravestone. It is more straightforward to think that people fight for fighting and seldom fight to work. The term 
"fight" is confrontational, a few steps after that are vicious, maybe backstabbing cutt-throats. But enough on those 
corners of questionably rectifying action. There is the wondrous notion, "methodologies exist for virtually any aspiiration", 
and then one can confuse the previous state of incapability with today's capability for application towards some mystery 
in the sea of machine-produced search results. Minimal states that are also of minimal influence through arrangements of 
finance and trade have questions to tend to: if the capability is there for more to be owned and produced, but the need 
is not... or... the need is there but the demand is the need is not for everyone... these nuances are somewhat silly to 
contemplate and stress over while in the idyllic state, but why wait until the oceans rise against? Another common issue 
is ambition that has narrowed its sights on some mirage, says those more knowledgeable. To harness the base instead of 
elevating the base is exploitation in the name of net-zero (the top profits). A counter-argument to the previous statement is 
the base would not go anywhere if it were all elevated. 

Maximization pushes meta-form, sourced from principle, into technical rigidity primed for the makers' purpose and possibly 
with no proof or material support from those not part of the base setting. These processes are serious and cannot be close to 
final without also failing. Commitment for results of completion: functionalities and appearances in zones of performance 
and/or chaos. Must there be an endgame from some of these minds, what difference does it make, and why must the possibility 
of the existence of an "endgame" be important? Do structures of magnanimous scale tend to outlive their purposeful functions 
that brought them into the will of erection by human beings? The functions bestowed entirely onto these structures could be maintained 
for longevity, but they are built to be subordinate to permitted users. Dust accumulates on them, and they become breeding grounds 
for life of a different scale from that of human beings, the nano-world. The nano-world has its own plans for what suits its 
way of life, and the structures made by human beings host them, morphs in conjunction with their guests' appetites, guests that 
will not leave until the feast is over. Many matters are abandoned by the heart or mind, but as long as there is material, there 
will always come newcomers to adopt what is left. The newcomers are guests from the vantage point of an entitled dignity bestowed 
onto the abandoned structure. But they have will that can be recognized as individuated challenges to the "whole". 

Western minimalism is demonstrated by the patterns of commerce committed to, streamlined and efficient and proven to be optimal 
by expertise. These patterns are partnered with a spirit of vigilance to know what novelties to accept (is the novelty really so once 
one discovers the source legacy?). Some may confuse the aesthetics of today's internet ecosystem, as viewed on the consumer side 
of personal computers, as minimalist by default. There are different thought groups responsible for the appearance of simplicity 
(if a computer has to add two numbers a million times in order to get the sum of the two numbers, that would be low efficiency). 
Freedom of application... scaling up and deriving from are processes that are as impressive as initial reception of them, and 
there is no guarantee of the impression having an incomprehensible mystery, the lack of comprehension from the other side almost 
entirely correlated to its market value, as if everything were up for sale. Vertical integration is a somewhat inaccurate but 
still applicable synonym for maximalization. When a vertically-integrated structure is slashed, new leadership is demanded and the 
calls may be urgent; this stands as a weakness to the multi-headedness of horizontal integration: each is free to move ahead and 
without in the advent the "whole" is slashed, but they will have difficulties compounding their capabilities due to their roughly 
equal comparisons.

Is minimalism restrictive in the manner of a human being "rationing" their will, being ultra-modest in the course of starvation, 
adhering to templated nice-speak? It should not be. When these practices cave in, complications arise and the mental backtracking 
a key ingredient for that wretched regret, produced from the realizations of insincerity, that could have yielded a better 
present. But the minimalism was violated in these events as specific cases evidence drives of maximizing, or may be drives for as 
little as simply winning in a comparative session. The trait of regeneration is a prime aspect of minimalism. There is a core (kernel) 
and it is not tangible in most cases and cannot be fully claimed by any one. When the meta-forms and rigid-forms come to light 
and eventually wither, the core can be used to output similar novelties. A reverence for a permanence that does not go 
haywire out of engineered complication. 

Some confuse minimalism with liberal (outward, loosely structured, roaming) or conservatory (inward,tight-knit,immobile) ideology. 
Minimalism is a way of life, first and foremost. Although it does not transcend petty commonists and political vitriol, thinking 
about this -ism as an independent -ism allows for something not stained by the drive. How much can minimalist practice take in before 
the super-structures produced from the massive success of its core just "randomly" get abandoned, aww the pretty goddess type sold out, 
pilfered, and abandoned? A question best left to the ration-alists, guided by that good information from their astute quantitots.
Maximizing these brilliant simplicities... imagine the lives that could be shared... after the complete construction of the 
super-structure. And then... from symbol of concentrated effort to a normalization of correlating certain classes and professions
as exclusive members of that super-structure... where is the love, they asketh... as they stay perched, the angelic beings, watching 
over the rest of the world spatially beneath them. How can one muster the pride to see and speak nothing but marvels about some 
vertically-integrated thing, when any one can swear (and turn out right) they will run out of spirit in the middle of their boasting 
one of these days?
