# Why Western Minimalism 
## by Richard Pham 

A lot could be wondered about the state of single-story buildings, miniaturized 
skyscrapers, and fragmented transportation system overseen by administrators that 
are most likely not fans of these systems turning transcontinental. There are a lot of 
people, according to the statistics. The people could be put to work, ok. They do not have 
to sit around, watch and sightseer, loaf around, and meddle in other people's affairs. That 
is pure social business. But the murky aspect to this freedom is that social business does 
not result in minimal manifestation. Social business affects the mind and turns its participants 
into what can be considered stations to be pinged, ports to receive goods, and anchors to immobilize 
the functions specially designed into product (so it really is all for show). A hard line could be drawn, 
for clarity, between the elaborate multi-tiered constructs devised by human beings and the complexities 
(with or without fruit) of social business. The social business does not have to yield great harvests 
or bring about discernible change of any point on the spectrum of negative to positive. "It just is, 
things just are, and let things be" are common defenses of the results of social business. And truthfully, 
it is rare to find anyone that has the time of effort as well as the genuine passion to challenge these 
defenses, based on collective notions of the norm and of adhering to the chain, without eventually 
learning lessons on what makes a good subject rather than a good slave; slaves labor past their point 
of comfort, past the point where their mind is an accurate receptor of stimuli and where their minds 
direct their bodies (when there is evidence every now and then of fluctuations of the heart moving the body 
and the body swaying the mind into a tail rather than a head). 

Some frequent themes emerge, under the umbrella of social critique on the policies of minimalism (maybe it is 
better to phrase "policies" as a "lack of concert from policies not agreed on"). If only all problems can be 
solved by building more after or without breaking less, these problems can be measured by the arbitrary value 
of metric used on a consistent basis for effective execution. But no, things break along the way.
